# TicTacToe Prototype in C!
This is an implementation of the classic TicTacToe game using only the good and old C programming languague. It was made to test the game logic of a college project and can be downloaded clicking [here](https://naldoni.itch.io/tictactoe-prototype-c).

## 🧱 Game structure
The game is set to be as minimalistic as possible, so it only has 1 menu and the controls are made using the left mouse key. 
To place a piece on the board just click on the quadrant you wanna play and a correct piece will be placed on it. After this the turn will pass and the seconde player cand do it as well.
